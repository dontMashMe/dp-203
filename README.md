Following documents are notes taken by me while learning for the `DP-203 : Microsoft Certified Azure Data Engineer Associate` certificate. 

It's mostly regurgitated content from the Microsoft Learning page, but I find this easier to work with.

This document/certificate assumes some existing knowledge about Data warehousing/ Data lake/ Big data.
